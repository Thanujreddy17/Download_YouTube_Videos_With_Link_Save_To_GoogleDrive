#pytube

I have used pytube beacause pytube is a lightweight, Pythonic, dependency-free, library (and command-line utility) for downloading YouTube Videos.


#Project Platform Googlecolab and language used is Python

I did this project on google colab.
I have imported gooogle drive from google.colab so that we can save all downloaded videos directly into gdrive.
We can save VIDEOS in drive and in any folders also...
